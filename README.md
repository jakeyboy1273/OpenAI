# recursive_code.py
This recursively generates code based on a propmt and fixes any errors then adds features as long as the recursive counter demands. One limitation is that if it adds a package dependency it will get stuck on how to "fix" the error because you'll need to install the package yourself. So for the first couple of iterations it helps to watch it and install any required packages that it comes up with!
